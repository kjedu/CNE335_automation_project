Step one:
Once AWS account was created I launched an EC2 t2.micro instance. I created and uploaded an ssh key to connect to my service through macOS terminal.

Step two:
After my EC2 instance was up and running and I forked the code template I solved the to-do's in the code. 
I used these two websites to help with "pinging servers in python" and one helped me with my pinging issues.
